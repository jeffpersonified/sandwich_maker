SandwichMe
==============

This is a simple rails app for my General Things application. The live app can be found at [sandwich-me.herokuapp.com](http://sandwich-me.herokuapp.com/).

The criteria were as follows:

*  Implement a Rails app for make_sandwich http://generalthings.com/2012/03/26/in-house-sandwich- app/
* Push the app to a public Github project, repeatedly (i.e. not just one big commit at the end, but use Git as it should be used throughout the life of the project)
* Push it to a public Heroku site so we can see the functioning app
* Create an input form to select what type of sandwich you want. Some options:
  - Meaty
	- Vegetarian
	- Vegan :-(
* At least one unit test (form submission for sandwich type, for example)
* Upon form submission, send a message out to someone at GT requesting your sandwich. Some
options:
	- Email (send the email to make_sandwich@generalthings.com)
	- Twitter (DM to @generalthings)
    - Text Message (ask us for a number if you choose to do this one)
* Include a random quote, preferably inspirational or cleverly insulting, with the message
* Implement user-friendly error reporting if there is a problem
* Implement a nice followup page if the message is sent successfully
* Add some extra credit!
	- Use Twitter Bootstrap
	- Add social media publishing (“I just ordered a sandwich from General Things Inc.”)
